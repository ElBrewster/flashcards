## Abstract

This project is a flashcard game played in the Command Line Interface. The user selects an answer to a coding problem question from of three choices. The game tracks the number of correct answers to inform the user of their progress and accuracy in understanding these questions.

## Technologies
The technologies used for this project were JavaScript, Visual Studio Code, Mocha and Chai.

## Install/Setup Instructions
Clone down the repo using GitHub. GitHub provides a link which can be used in the terminal after typing github clone. Then enter the respective directory in the terminal. Type node index.js, and start playing inside the terminal.

## Context:
I am on my first week of the the second inning of the Turing coding bootcamp program. This is my first time writing test functions before implementing code for a project. The amount of files, organization and class requirements build on the learning from the first inning. A mentor said to me, "Flashcards is like super mythicals". (Mythical creatures was a collection of small class tests with their implementation that we worked on in our first inning).

## Learning Goals:
* Contribute code to an partially constructed object-oriented application
* Follow spec/prompts to make a working application
* Implement ES6 classes
* Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
* Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
